The Office of Child Development and Early Learning in col-laboration with the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education have overseen revisions to the standards. Each set of standards has been formulated with help and guidance from practitioners and program special- ists who represented early childhood programs, school districts, higher education, family leaders, policy analysts, and researchers. A group of Pennsylvania educators, in conjunction with the Office of Child Devel-opment and Early Learning, created a set of Pennsylvania Core Standards beginning with Pre-Kindergarten. The Pennsylvania Core Standards start in Pre-Kindergarten and continue through 12th grade. The Pennsyl-vania State Board of Education adopted the Pennsylvania Core Standards in March 2014. The 2014 revisions include updates related to the Pennsylvania Core Standards; Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) supportive practices; and current research trends. Learning Standards for Early Childhood are used to: • Inform professionals about curriculum and assessment • Guide the selection of instructional materials and the design of interactions/goal setting • Inform families of appropriate expectations for children • Provide a common framework for community-based birth–grade 3 alignment work Learning Standards for Early Childhood are NOT used as: • A specific curriculum • A means to prohibit children from moving from one grade or age level to another • A specific assessment of the competence of children or teachers Introduction Children are born with

community-based birth–grade 3 alignment work Learning Standards for Early Childhood are NOT used as: • A specific curriculum • A means to prohibit children from moving from one grade or age level to another • A specific assessment of the competence of children or teachers Introduction Children are born with an incredible capacity and desire to learn. More than 40 years of research confirms the founda-tional importance of early education and care for children’s school and life success. It is essential that children’s first experiences are robust ones, steeped in activities that develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills, a deep understanding about themselves in a social society, and age-appropriate content. Instructional practices must embed the domains of development— cognitive, social-emotional, language, and physical—with approaches to learning that enable children to explore, understand, and reach beyond the “here and now” to challenge themselves, experiment, and transform information into meaningful content and skills. Professionals interacting with young children have the critical task of providing rich information and experiences. Such experiences build skills and understanding in the context of everyday routines and within intentionally-designed play opportunities that capture children’s inter-ests and curiosity. Pennsylvania’s Learning Standards for Early Child-hood are designed to support and enhance the learning environment; responsive relationships; age, cultural, and linguistically-appropriate curriculum; and practices being used to assess children, classrooms, and programs. The Department of Education and the Office of Child Development and Early Learning use a Standards Aligned System. The Standards Aligned System is a collective body of research that identifies six elements which, when used together, provide a framework for program improve-ment and child success. The elements identified are standards, as-sessments, curriculum framework, instruction (including interven-tions), safe and supportive schools, and materials and resources. A web-based portal including more information and resources related to these elements is accessible at

STANDARDS ALIGNED SYSTEM (SAS) INSTRUCTION CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK ASSESSMENT STANDARDS SAFE AND SUPPORTIVE SCHOOLS MATERIALS AND RESOURCES STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT 4 1. Standards Education in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math beginning Learning standards provide the framework for learning. They provide the foundational information for what children should be able to know and do. Pennsylvania’s Learning Standards for Early Childhood build on information learned previously, creating a continuum of learning that assures consistent and linked learning that begins in infancy, increasing in complexity as it extends through graduation. Pennsylvania also uses program standards that assure children’s experiences are being offered in high-quality settings. Pennsylvania’s state-funded programs all offer similar sets of standards that provide guidance on program operation that exhibit best practices. 2. Assessments Professionals must use both informal and formal assessments to understand children’s progress. In early childhood, formative assess-ments that provide information about how children are progressing allow professionals to make adaptations or adjustments in the indi-vidualized learning plans for every child. Early childhood professionals observe and assess children using the materials that are found in the learning environment. Professionals must use the information they have documented during observation, along with information from the family, to identify goals and next steps for children’s learning. 3. Curriculum framework A curriculum framework reminds us what information should be taught to young children within each of the Key Learning Areas. It assures the continuum of learning that begins at birth and continues through graduation. Pennsylvania’s curriculum framework includes big ideas, essential questions, concepts,

steps for children’s learning. 3. Curriculum framework A curriculum framework reminds us what information should be taught to young children within each of the Key Learning Areas. It assures the continuum of learning that begins at birth and continues through graduation. Pennsylvania’s curriculum framework includes big ideas, essential questions, concepts, and competencies that further define the learning standards. 4. Instruction including interventions Instruction in the early years often looks different than instruction in the older grades. Learning occurs within the context of play and active learning strategies where children are engaged in concrete and hands-on discovery; experimentation; and interaction with materials, their peers, and nurturing adults. Professionals help construct knowledge during these active learning times by designing activities that build on children’s prior knowledge to create new understandings and information. Direct instruction should be combined with child-initiated play to produce optimal con-ditions for young children’s learning. Adults become facilitators who interact with children throughout the day. Adults ask open-ended ques-tions that encourage children to think about what comes next. With this approach, adults support children’s creativity, problem-solving, intuition, and inventiveness (approaches to learning) by challenging and encouraging them. Professionals design focused instruction that is based on the identified individual needs of every child and assure these experiences encompass their interests, abilities, and culture. STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) education is an intentional, integrative approach to teaching and learning, in which students uncover and acquire a comprehensive set of concepts, competencies, and thinking skills of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics that they transfer and apply in both academic and real-world contexts. at birth is supported by research in neuroscience and other develop-mental sciences.

technology, engineering, and mathematics that they transfer and apply in both academic and real-world contexts. at birth is supported by research in neuroscience and other develop-mental sciences. This research shows that the basic architecture of a child’s brain is constructed through an ongoing process that begins before birth and continues through adulthood. Research also confirms that the brain is predominantly receptive to learning math and logic between the ages of 1 and 4, and that early math skills are the most powerful predictors of later learning. Providing children with oppor-tunities to have early experiences in STEM supports children in their academic growth, develops early critical thinking and reasoning skills, and enhances later interest in STEM careers. The foundations of STEM learning lie in the natural inquiry and exploration of young children, as well as intentionally-designed activities which build scientific and mathematical concepts, and the effective use of available technologies. Positive interactions early in life, in an environment intentionally designed to provide STEM experiences where children explore, ask questions, and receive support from educators will help to lay this foundation. Early-learning STEM experiences are based on the Penn-sylvania Learning Standards for Early Childhood for infants and toddlers, prekindergarten, and kindergarten through grade 2. STEM subjects are supported within these standards and are noted by the symbol throughout the supportive practices. Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math are not separate subjects broken down into their own time slots. These topics of study are incorporated and encouraged within all activities throughout the day. In addition, laying this early foundation will help to bridge the educational gap between birth to age 5 and K-12 educational programs. Interventions • Early childhood special education Early childhood classrooms should be inclusive ones where children with disabilities and developmental delays are enjoying learning experience alongside their typically developing peers.

addition, laying this early foundation will help to bridge the educational gap between birth to age 5 and K-12 educational programs. Interventions • Early childhood special education Early childhood classrooms should be inclusive ones where children with disabilities and developmental delays are enjoying learning experience alongside their typically developing peers. Professionals may need to adapt or modify the classroom environment, interactions, and/or materials and equipment to help children with disabilities fully participate. Pennsylvania’s Learning Standards for Early Childhood are designed to be used for all children. The content within these standards provides the breadth of information from which to create goals and experiences for all children that will help them reach their highest potential while capturing their interests and building on what they already know. Professionals must emphasize and celebrate all children’s accomplish - ments and focus on what all children can do. • English Language Learners/Dual Language Learners Children develop language much the same way they acquire other skills. Children learn native and second languages using an indi-vidual style and rate. Differences among English Language Learners/ Dual Language Learners such as mixing languages or a silent period are natural. Each child’s progress in learning English needs to be respected and viewed as acceptable and part of the ongoing process of learning any new skill. Children can demonstrate proficiency in most of the standards using their native language. Use of home language in the classroom environment, and in simple phrases, validates a child’s place in the classroom, encouraging the child to see him/herself as a learner. Working alongside English-speaking adults and peers in authentic learning experiences which respect home language is an 5 effective means of learning English. Similar to all young children, English Language Learners/Dual Language Learners benefit from use of visuals, props, and realia (objects from real life

to see him/herself as a learner. Working alongside English-speaking adults and peers in authentic learning experiences which respect home language is an 5 effective means of learning English. Similar to all young children, English Language Learners/Dual Language Learners benefit from use of visuals, props, and realia (objects from real life used in classroom instruction to improve children’s understanding of other cultures and real life situations). The skills needed for young English Language Learners/Dual Language Learners to become proficient in English are fully embedded in the Pennsylvania Learning Standards for Early Childhood. 5. Materials and resources Every early-learning setting, whether it is in a home atmosphere or center-based classroom, must be a comfortable, safe, and nurturing environment where children can learn through their play. Children discover and understand science, social studies, and math informa-tion when they actively explore materials and ideas that are guided by professionals who intentionally design activities that engage children in critical thinking and processing. Children also learn about their own abilities and learning styles, how to get along with others, and how to appreciate others’ contributions in classrooms that include a diverse set of materials and experiences. School environments should be linked to a child’s home environment, incorporating cultural and ethnic materials and children’s home language, and provide experiences that are inclusive for all children, regardless of ability, socio-economic status, or family background. Well-designed environments demonstrate a commitment to the whole child by offering materials and activities that promote social, physi-cal, cognitive, and language learning.

Safe and supportive schools The safe and supportive schools element found on the Standards Aligned System portal showcases resources and exemplars that pro-mote active child engagement in a safe and positive learning environ-ment. The three areas of focus within safe and supportive schools are: Engagement—Program engagement is essential for child suc- cess and building a positive program climate. Engagement within a program is a process of events and opportunities that lead to children gaining the skills and confidence needed to cope and feel safe within their environment. These events and opportunities include relation-ships, respect for cultural diversity, and family participation. Relation-ships are the connection between two or more people or groups and their involvement with and behavior toward one another. Respect for diversity shows an understanding, appreciation, and response to differ-ences in individuals or groups. Family participation includes the active involvement within classroom and school events. Safety—Program safety refers to the security of the setting and program-related activities as perceived and experienced by all stake-holders, including families, caregivers, children, school staff, and the community. Program safety encompasses both emotional and physical safety, and is influenced by positive and negative behaviors of children and staff. Emotional safety focuses on the feeling of connection, com- fort, and acceptance within a secure setting. Physical safety ensures children are free from danger or threatening circumstances. Environment—Program environment refers to the extent to which program settings promote child safety and health. Environment is inclusive of all aspects of a program—academic components, its physical and mental health supports and services, and its physical building and location within a community. The physical environment looks at the external surrounding and physical conditions within a program. Classroom

which program settings promote child safety and health. Environment is inclusive of all aspects of a program—academic components, its physical and mental health supports and services, and its physical building and location within a community. The physical environment looks at the external surrounding and physical conditions within a program. Classroom assessment instruments that help providers assess the arrangement of indoor space, the provision of materials and activities, and their development of class schedules are useful in a sharing best practice implementation and alignment to Pennsylvania’s Learning Standards for Early Childhood. The academic environment is the climate set within a program that values and promotes learning and self-fulfillment. Wellness within a program supports good physical and mental health, including the promotion of a proper diet, exercise, and healthy habits. EARLY CHILDHOOD CONNECTIONS High quality early care and education programs also promote con-nections that assure children’s school success. Programs that build relationships with children and families and coordinate their work with other early-learning programs and school districts create strong partnerships for success. 1. Connections to children Relationships are the key to successful connections between the adult and the child. Professionals must take time to know every child, to understand the way in which each child learns best, and to identify the special talents and skills each child possesses. Adults who work with young children must be students themselves. They must learn about children’s home experiences and culture so they can design learning environments that support the home-school connection and expand prior learning into new knowledge. 2. Connections to families Families of young children have much to offer in the learning process. When a partnership is formed between professional and family, the connection has been strengthened, assuring that children receive consistent messages about learning and skill development. Families should be given opportunities to

into new knowledge. 2. Connections to families Families of young children have much to offer in the learning process. When a partnership is formed between professional and family, the connection has been strengthened, assuring that children receive consistent messages about learning and skill development. Families should be given opportunities to learn about their children’s day at school, to provide input into the information they want their children to learn and master, and to understand what they can do at home to enhance the learning experience. To assure effective family engage-ment strategies, professionals can reference the Partnerships for Learning Standards. At-home resources for families such as Kindergarten, Here I Come; Kindergarten, Here I Am; Learning Is Everywhere; Building Blocks for Babies; Every Day I Learn through Play; and Recipes for Readi- ness provide professionals and families tools to share age-appropriate expectations and to connect learning experiences. Family ethnicity and culture must be interwoven into the life of an early childhood program and classroom. Professionals must embrace all children’s heritages and provide activities, materials, and experi-ences that help children become aware of and appreciate their own culture while learning about and appreciating the similarities and dif-ferences of others. Families can provide authentic cultural experiences and resources that support cultural awareness and appreciation. Such opportunities foster family and school relations and partnerships. Communications with families should be made in the home language. Professionals in high quality, early education programs know and understand their own attitudes and biases and are culturally sensitive and supportive of diversity. 6 3. Connections with other early-learning programs To assure effective family engagement strategies, professionals can reference the Partnerships for Learning Standards. Children and families often have other needs and priorities in addition to participation in high quality early care and education programs. 4. Connections for learning Families may

Children and families often have other needs and priorities in addition to participation in high quality early care and education programs. 4. Connections for learning Families may need to coordinate their early care and education program services with health services or early intervention services, as well as with their other children’s school experiences. Programs within a community that support families’ single point of contact or help to coordinate services for children demonstrate a strong understanding and respect for families. Providers that reach out to neighborhood schools to facilitate transition into the public school or who have de-veloped a working relationship with their intervention provider assure linkages that support children’s school readiness and ongoing success. Young children make learning connections through authentic hands-on experiences. Professionals that allow children time to explore and discover both inside and outside, optimize children’s capacity to internalize and generalize content by making their own connections to prior knowledge. All children, regardless of age and ability, need opportunities to engage in practice activities and experiences that are steeped in play. Adults should design learning experiences with con-nections among multiple domains. Integrated learning experiences support both content and social and cultural learning. THE LEARNING STANDARDS CONTINUUM Within all Pennsylvania’s Learning Standards for Early Child-hood, the Key Learning Areas define the domains or areas of children’s learning that assure a holistic approach to instruction. All children, regardless of age and ability, should be ex-posed to experiences that build their skill development in approaches to learning, social and emotional development, language and literacy development, health wellness and physical development, creative expression, and the cognitive areas of mathematics, science, and social studies.

regardless of age and ability, should be ex-posed to experiences that build their skill development in approaches to learning, social and emotional development, language and literacy development, health wellness and physical development, creative expression, and the cognitive areas of mathematics, science, and social studies. The Standards within each Key Learning Area provide the information that children should know and the skills children should be able to do when they leave the age level or grade. Pennsylvania’s Learning Standards for Early Childhood are connected through a continuum of learning and link to the 3rd grade academic standards. Some skills will not emerge in a noticeable way until a child is older. These standards will be intentionally blank or identified as emerging. Professionals who view children’s skill development across ages and grades will be able to understand the sequential way children learn and become familiar with the way in which teachers at higher grade levels support learning. AGE GROUPING IN PENNSYLVANIA’S LEARNING STANDARDS FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD Learning Standards for Infant-Toddler The Infant-Toddler Standards are divided into three age levels: infant (birth through 12 months), young toddler (9 months–27 months), and older toddler (24 months through 36 months). These age divi-sions are arbitrary as a means for organizing the content; very young children’s development is uneven and may span two or all three of the age levels in different Key Areas of Learning. This is reflected by the overlap of the age 9 months–27 months in younger toddlers. The Standards in each Key Area of Learning are displayed on an Infant- Toddler continuum with the content within one strand presented together. Practitioners can look down each level to determine the skills that best match their children’s current development, identifying addi-tional concepts and competencies, and supportive practices to scaffold children’s learning.

Area of Learning are displayed on an Infant- Toddler continuum with the content within one strand presented together. Practitioners can look down each level to determine the skills that best match their children’s current development, identifying addi-tional concepts and competencies, and supportive practices to scaffold children’s learning. When strands include “emerging” these concepts are beginning to emerge but are not expected to be mastered. For example, infants and young toddlers may be exploring mathematical estimation as they interact with materials, but intentional instruction would not be appropriate for that age. Adults should continue to introduce these concepts whenever appropriate for the individual child without expec-tation of mastery. Learning Standards for Pre-Kindergarten Professionals will find the skills that pre-kindergarteners (ages three to five) are practicing and mastering within the pre-kindergarten standards. Younger preschoolers will be learning the content, while older children will be mastering the skills and showing proficiency. Classroom environments, materials, and activities that are developed for this age will be appropriate for both three- and four-year-olds; expectations for mastery will be different. Learning Standards for Kindergarten Students who complete kindergarten should demonstrate mastery of the skills within the kindergarten standards. This document is designed for full-day kindergarten classrooms. Half-day kindergarten teachers will need to modify the amount of content that is introduced to children during the kindergarten year, but the cognitive processing that children must develop and the holistic instruction will remain constant regardless of the length of the kindergarten day. It is critical that kindergarten instruction occurs through an active learning approach where teachers use differentiated instructional strategies and focus on learning centers and play as key elements of the daily schedule. Child-initiated investigation should be predominant with supportive direct instruction in content areas infused through-out the day. Kindergarten children should be given opportunities to develop social and

an active learning approach where teachers use differentiated instructional strategies and focus on learning centers and play as key elements of the daily schedule. Child-initiated investigation should be predominant with supportive direct instruction in content areas infused through-out the day. Kindergarten children should be given opportunities to develop social and emotional skills, physical skills, and their creative expression within the course of a kindergarten day. 7 1 2 3 4 5 6GUIDING PRINCIPLES High-quality early care and education programs offer learning opportunities that have a significant impact on the success of all children. A warm, responsive relationship with a highly- trained teaching staff is foundational. It is expected that teachers will intentionally integrate developmental knowledge with the attitudes, skills, and concepts children need to make progress socially and aca-demically. High-quality early care and education programs maintain high developmentally achievable expectations for all children using clear performance standards with a continuous cycle of assessment understood and used by staff, children, and families. All who care for and educate infants and tod-dlers, whether in formal or informal early learning settings, have a significant impact on children’s future successes. Healthy attachment relationships are critical for successful early learning during the infant and toddler years and provide the essential founda-tion on which all subsequent learning occurs. All infants and toddlers can learn and deserve suitably high expectations that are age-, individu-ally, and culturally appropriate. Infants and toddlers learn best through meaning-ful play; concrete sensory interactions; and intentional activities, experiences, and ac-tive exploration of their environment as well as through interactions with adults in the context of routine care. The multiple learning environments for infants and toddlers should stimulate and engage their curiosity of the world around them and meet their needs in all domains so children are and feel healthy, safe, secure, and nurtured.

environment as well as through interactions with adults in the context of routine care. The multiple learning environments for infants and toddlers should stimulate and engage their curiosity of the world around them and meet their needs in all domains so children are and feel healthy, safe, secure, and nurtured. Language and early literacy development must be supported and integrated throughout all aspects of formal and informal early care and education programs for infants and toddlers. 7 8 9 10 11 Infants’ and toddlers’ learning, development, and opportunities are supported when their teachers are trained in early childhood develop-ment and education, including professional training and ongoing professional development specific to infants and toddlers; are intentional in their relationships; and work with families to increase knowledge and support of child development. Early care and education programs must ad- dress the individual needs of all infants and toddlers (e.g. with special needs, from diverse cultural backgrounds, from all socio-economic groups, etc.) and respect their families. Early care and education programs are de- fined by a set of comprehensive standards that maximize an infant’s or toddler’s growth and de-velopment across all domains and that recognize that the domains are dynamically inter-related, especially during the infant and toddler years. Effective support for infant/toddler development requires a system of research-based assessment that documents infants’ and toddlers’ growth and development in relationship to a refined set of standards and is used to inform practice. Infants’ and toddlers’ learning is enhanced when families, early learning environments/settings, and communities work together to provide conti-nuity of high quality care. 8 THE LEARNING STANDARDS FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD FORMAT TAG LINE ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS – Linked to the BIG IDEAS and provides the questions that support children’s inquiry BIG IDEAS – Describes the information that children should acquire across all age levels

Infant 9 Approaches to Learning through Play Constructing, Organizing, and Applying Knowledge AL.1 Constructing and Gathering Knowledge AL.2 Organizing and Understanding Information AL.3 Applying Knowledge AL.4 Learning through Experience Approaches to Learning through Play Standards (ALPS) describe the es- sential life skills that enable a child to grow, learn, develop, and become a successful member of his/her community. The use and develop-ment of these skills begin at birth and continue across the human life span. ALPS addresses how a child gathers and constructs knowledge, organizes and un-derstands information, applies that knowledge, and transfers the self-constructed learning beyond the immediate moment. The child must develop these im-perative capacities to understand and use the content of literacy, mathematics, science, and social studies, as well as necessary emotional wellbeing and lifelong success. It is essential to provide children with optimal learning opportunities that feature the development of these skills as the key component of 21st century classrooms across our state. From

understand and use the content of literacy, mathematics, science, and social studies, as well as necessary emotional wellbeing and lifelong success. It is essential to provide children with optimal learning opportunities that feature the development of these skills as the key component of 21st century classrooms across our state. From the moment of birth, healthy children are in a con-tinuous state of exploring, discovering, and constructing meaningful relationships with the world around them. These innate qualities support children as they venture out to connect with and understand the world in which they live. When children are encouraged to follow their innate inquisi-tiveness, they develop processes that enable them to succeed in answering important self-constructed “how” or “I wonder” questions. While children follow their own self-directed leads, they may be unsure of the outcome but are willing to take that risk to find out what will happen next. This outlook provides children with great pleasure as they interact successfully to understand their world; therefore, they desire to return to this preferred state of mind again and again. Children enjoy learning that includes active self-direction, positive anticipation, risk-taking, pleasure, knowledge con-construction, absorption in the moment, and the desire to return to this state of mind, which is what we call play. Therefore, play is a powerful learning tool that enables the child to grow and develop a lifelong love of learning. Play is the child’s natural state of mind and therefore influences all of the child’s domains of development including physical, cognitive, lan-guage, social, aesthetic, and emo-tional. And equally as important, play as a focused state of mind provides the child with a context and positive attitude in which to develop their Approaches to Learning skills, which are shown to lead to lifelong success.

And equally as important, play as a focused state of mind provides the child with a context and positive attitude in which to develop their Approaches to Learning skills, which are shown to lead to lifelong success. Play, Play, and Play Some More! The best way to support children’s learning in the early years is to provide hands-on, active learning experi-ences that include play activities. Play enables children to weave together past knowledge and new information to acquire new understanding and skill development. A child who discovers the characteristics of apples through manipulating, investigating, and exploring them understands the depth of apples better than a child who colors a worksheet picture of an apple. Children can cooperate in the block area to determine how many blocks can be added to a structure before it falls. This type of play enhances children’s social and creative think-ing sequences. Play sequences and activities expand across all Key Areas of Learning and can build social, cognitive, and physical skill development when they are intentionally planned and facilitated by teachers who interact with children, ask-ing open-ended questions to scaffold children’s thinking and problem-solving. 10 APPROACHES TO LEARNING THROUGH PLAY: CONSTRUCTING, ORGANIZING, AND APPLYING KNOWLEDGE AL.1 Constructing and Gathering Knowledge BIG IDEAS: Children actively construct knowledge through routines, play, practices, and language.

It is a way to share one’s ideas and understand the ideas of others. Reading involves the use of pictures, symbols, and text to gain information and derive meaning, and writing is used for a variety of purposes. Children should be exposed to a variety of books to acquire new information and for person-al fulfillment. Children apply a wide range of strategies to comprehend, interpret, evaluate, and appreciate text. Children draw meaning from their prior knowledge and experience, their interactions with others, their knowl-edge of word meaning, and their word identification strategies. Children vary their use of the spoken and written language to communicate effectively with others. One of the first building blocks of reading is phonemic awareness; this is one of the best predictors of early reading achievement. Children should be developing this awareness in the early years by listening to rhyming stories and songs and engaging in word play activities. Diversity and Culture Today’s early childhood programs include increasingly diverse groups of children, families, and teachers who represent many cultures, values, and lifestyles.

by listening to rhyming stories and songs and engaging in word play activities. Diversity and Culture Today’s early childhood programs include increasingly diverse groups of children, families, and teachers who represent many cultures, values, and lifestyles. Providers have a unique opportunity to create welcoming environments that emphasize respect for diversity and support families’ cultural and linguistic differences. Teachers must help assure the preservation of home language while supporting the acquisition of Standard English. Programs should create experiences and opportunities that honor all children’s cultures and values by developing creative strategies for including and expanding home to school connections and by providing children with varied ways to demonstrate their learning. Such experiences and opportunities assure all children’s success in school. 24 LANGUAGE AND LITERACY DEVELOPMENT: ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS 1.1 Foundational Skills BIG IDEA: Emerging reading involves the use of pictures, symbols, and text to gain information and derive meaning.

2.3 Geometry 2.4 Measurement, Data, and Probability Use of Manipulatives in Early Learning Settings Small toys or objects may be one of the most important teaching tools for early childhood classrooms. Counters, pegs, and/or small blocks support children’s learning in math and science as a means of learning complex concepts. As children combine, sort, count, or describe the characteristics of these small objects, they are using active, hands-on strategies for problem-solving, exploration, and experimentation, and scaffolding previous knowledge and interactions to learn new information. In addition, children are learning mo-tor control, patterns, and concrete ways to understand abstract ideas. All classrooms should provide ample opportunities for children’s independent access to ma-nipulatives throughout the daily routine. Mathematical learning is a key element of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education. To fully understand math, children must be able to connect mathematical concepts to real-world situations and across disciplines. Math skills are developed and based on children’s expe-riences with their environment, their interactions with adults and other children, and their daily observations. Throughout the early years of life, children notice and discover math- ematical dimensions of their world. They compare quantities, find patterns, prob-lem-solve, communicate, and confront real problems such as balancing a tall block building or angling a ramp to roll a ball down. Mathematics helps children make sense of their world and helps them construct a solid foundation for future success. By asking intentional questions, adults can help encourage STEM concepts where children are identifying objects, making comparisons, making pre-dictions, testing ideas, and sharing discoveries, all while investigating their environment.Mathematical thinking is foundational and important to academic success in all subjects. All children are capable of developing a strong knowledge of mathematics in their earliest years. Math and science subjects are connected to other subject mat-ters and the real world.

Organisms 3.1B Biological Sciences – Genetics 3.1C Biological Sciences – Evolution 3.2A Physical Sciences – Chemistry 3.2B Physical Sciences – Physics 3.3A Earth and Space Sciences – Earth Structures, Processes, and Cycles Children are born with natural curiosity and the innate science and math skills to interpret and respond to the world. Children learn about Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) concepts through play. They explore, experiment, invent, design and test solutions, and form ideas about how the world works. Technology, engineering, and math are the application of science to the design, creation and construction of things. Children, who are given opportunities to conduct experi-ments, gather data and make conclusions, are developing skills that support discovery about the natural world and scientific inquiry. Adults support science in play by providing an engaging environment and facilitating appropriately. Scientific play is enhanced with natural objects. High quality early learning environ-ments provide children with the structure in which to build upon their natural desire to explore, to build, and to question. Adults must acknowledge and support chil-dren in extending their curiosity through the scientific process of inquiry, observing, asking questions, forming hypothesis, investigating, gathering data, drawing con-clusions, and building ideas that lead to new questions. 4.1 Environment and Ecology – Ecology 4.2 Environment and Ecology – Watersheds and Wetlands 4.3 Environment and Ecology – Agriculture and Society 4.4 Environment and Ecology – Humans and the Environment 15.4 Computer and Information Technology Facilitating Scientific Inquiry Adults facilitate scientific inquiry when class- rooms or learning environments are struc- tured to promote curios- ity.

environments are struc- tured to promote curios- ity. Scientific inquiry is the active search for knowl-edge and occurs most success-fully when adults intentionally create activities and experiences that allow children to use previ- ously learned knowledge to understand new information. One role of the adult during this active exploration is to scaffold children’s thinking by asking open- ended questions. Open-ended questions en-courage problem-solving and support children’s learning of the world around them. Open-ended questions are a more effective strategy to encourage learning and critical thinking when compared to closed questions, which typically result in short answers that don’t provide insight into children’s thinking. When learning environ-ments are structured to promote curiosity, children use strategies that are based on scientific inquiry. 54 SCIENTIFIC THINKING AND TECHNOLOGY: EXPLORING, SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY , AND DISCOVERY 3.1 Biological Sciences BIG IDEAS: Living things have unique characteristics which differ from non-living things.

When children are taught skills to assist them in positive communication, coping, and interpersonal relationships, challenging behaviors can be prevented. For a smaller group of children more focused efforts can be applied to address specific behavioral needs. An even smaller population of children will need more intensive interventions in collaboration with trained professionals. This tiered-approach to addressing behavior contributes to a safe A and supportive environment in which all children are respected and valued. ll children need early child- hood experiences that nurture emotional security, positive self-concept, and respect for others.
