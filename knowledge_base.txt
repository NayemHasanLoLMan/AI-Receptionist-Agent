Learning Standards Development
Pennsylvania’s Learning Standards for Early Childhood were originally constructed as a joint project of the
Departments of Education and Human Services . The Office of Child Development and Early Learning in col-
laboration with the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education have overseen revisions to the standards .
Each set of standards has been formulated with help and guidance from practitioners and program special-
ists who represented early childhood programs, school districts, higher education, family leaders, policy
analysts, and researchers . A group of Pennsylvania educators, in conjunction with the Office of Child Devel-
opment and Early Learning, created a set of Pennsylvania Core Standards beginning with Pre-Kindergarten .
The Pennsylvania Core Standards start in Pre-Kindergarten and continue through 12th grade . The Pennsyl-
vania State Board of Education adopted the Pennsylvania Core Standards in March 2014 . The 2014 revisions
include updates related to the Pennsylvania Core Standards; Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math
(STEM) supportive practices; and current research trends .
Learning Standards for Early Childhood are used to:
• Inform professionals about curriculum and assessment
• Guide the selection of instructional materials and the design of interactions/goal setting
• Inform families of appropriate expectations for children
• Provide a common framework for community-based birth–grade 3 alignment work
Learning Standards for Early Childhood are NOT used as:
• A specific curriculum
• A means to prohibit children from moving from one grade or age level to another

APPROACHES TO LEARNING THROUGH PLAY: CONSTRUCTING, ORGANIZING, AND APPLYING KNOWLEDGE
AL.1 Constructing and Gathering Knowledge
BIG IDEA: Children actively construct knowledge through routines, play, practices, and language . Children use a variety of strategies to
gather information based upon their own individualized approach to learning .

including play?

PARTNERSHIPS FOR LEARNING: FAMILIES, EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS, AND COMMUNITIES
PL 3: Families have the support and information they need to encourage their
children’s learning and development.
BIG IDEAS: Families are children’s first teachers and foremost experts . They are the common link throughout a child’s educational
experience . Information and support in the early years forms the foundation for lifelong informed and engaged parenting .
ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS: What policies and procedures are in place to provide information and support families to encourage their
children’s learning and development and to access additional support if needed? How do I ensure that information provided to families
reflects best practice and current knowledge? How does our program ensure that information exchange is reciprocal and used to
support the child’s development?
THE BOND BETWEEN CHILD AND FAMILY IS THE STABLE CONNECTOR THROUGHOUT A CHILD’S LIFE. FAMILIES
