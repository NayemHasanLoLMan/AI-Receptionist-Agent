### Introduction

**English Language Development Standards Framework**  
The Pennsylvania Department of Education convened the English Language Proficiency Standards Workgroup in 2015 to revise and update standards to correlate with Pennsylvania Core/Academic Standards, with an aim to provide equitable access to subject content for English Learners (ELs).

### Standards Framework

**Modeling After WIDA’s Standards**  
The framework is modeled after WIDA’s English Language Proficiency Standards, retaining the five overarching standards for Kindergarten through Grade 12 and enhancing academic language rigor across subject content areas.

### Pennsylvania English Language Development Standards

**Framework Design for Educators**  
Designed to aid educators in effectively differentiating instruction and assessment across content areas for ELs at various English Language Proficiency levels. The standards integrate social and academic language acquisition across grades:
- Standard 1: Communication in English for social and instructional purposes within the school setting.
- Standards 2 to 5: Communication of information, ideas, and concepts necessary for academic success in Language Arts, Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies.

### Grade-Level Standards

**Detailed Breakdown Per Grade**  
Each grade level from Pre-K to 12 has detailed standards for:
- Social and Instructional language
- Language Arts
- Mathematics
- Science
- Social Studies

For each subject area and grade level, standards detail receptive (listening, reading) and productive (speaking, writing) skills expected at multiple proficiency stages (Entering, Emerging, Developing, Expanding, Bridging), providing clear criteria for progress assessment.
